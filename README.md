# Rock, Paper, Scissors

The goal of our project was to emulate rock, paper, scissors simulations like the one in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usN7JJ_Uml0).

## Running the Code
The RPS file contains the main method which runs the simulation. Once the CanvasWindow is up, the user may use the text input fields to change the team sizes as indicated by the text in the UI on the left side of the screen. To start, stop, or reset the simulation, the user can press the appropriately labeled button in the UI. To end the simulation, the user can close the CanvasWindow.

## Bugs
- There remains a bug where the START button may have to be pressed twice to start the program after a reset.
